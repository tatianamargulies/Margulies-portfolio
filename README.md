# Margulies-portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the "Telling Stories with Data" class at CMU!

# About me
This is Tatiana Margulies, student of Master of Science in information Technology with orientation in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. I am from Argentina and my background is in Actuarial Science. I worked in Zurich Insurance company for two years as an Actuarial Analyst. Now, I am working at IAG as a Business Performance Analyst.

# What I hope to learn
I am particularly interested in this course because I work with Tableau Dashboards and I am trying to improve and re-design existing visualizations to simplifly the user experience at the time of looking at the graphs and get the story the data is telling. Apart from that, I think this course will provide me techniques to be more critical at the time of looking at visualizations and skills to be more persuasive. Once I graduate, I would like to keep working on the visualization/analytics area and apply the concepts I will learn in the course.
