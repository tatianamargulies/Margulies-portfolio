# Outline

The idea of the project is to give hope to people with the message that generosity in poor countries like some in Africa, can be a key issue to increase longevity. I will start showing that there is a correlation with factors like GDP, diseases, deaths and therefore, high/low life expectancy. However, one of my findings is that generosity is higher in the countries that are less developed and this is something that we have control about. I will show studies saying that that social factors, sharing with people, helping others can contribute to have a healthly lifestyle. Because of that, I think that living longer starts with us. The audience is the population and the message is motivational. In conclusion, the idea is to convince them that even though there are things that as individuals we cannot control because they are external and more related to government strategies, policies, development of the country, etc everyone can make a little contribution to solve this problem by adopting generous practices in our daily lives.

Project structure

-Setup: Developed countries have higher life expectancy than developing countries.

-Conflict: The reasons driving life expectancy appear to be external, related to government policies/strategies

-Resolution: Generosity could make us live longer and as it is internal, we can adopt it.

# Data

The data to be used in the project consist of three different datasets,

1) Life expectancy: This is the main dataset which includes information about all the countries with different time periods from 2000 to 2015. It shows the life expectancy values for each country, some diseases such as HIV/Hepathitis/ Measles, infant deaths, developed countries, public expenditure on health, schooling, etc. It is going to be used as the main dataset to analyze. The idea is to create trendlines of life expectancy over time for some countries, a map visualizing developed vs developing countries, bar charts analizing some diseases/public spenditure for comparisons.

2) Mapping of continents: This dataset has the mapping of countries and continents to provide some information at a higher level. It will be used at the beginning to show a summary of the situation by continent instead of showing all the countries. This is an intermediate dataset to summarize information but it does not provide new data,it is a different grouping that I will use not to overload the reader with the visualizations.

3) Happiness world index: This dataset has a list of countries with the happiness score for each country as well as the rank. It also shows how factors such as family, trust in government, generosity, contribute to the happiness score. It is going to be merged with the life expectancy dataset using the country as the primary key and, the idea will be to use the generosity information to show that for some countries with low life expectancy, it can be a powerful factor to improve the average in the long term.

# Method and Medium
 The project is going to be developed using Shorthand as a tool to create the presentation and the tool to generate the visualizations will be mainly Tableau.
 The reason of using Shorthand is that it is powerful for presentations, it provides many functionalities and features that other platforms do not have. It is eye-catching for the audience so it helps to build the idea in an engaging way. Tableau is user-friendly as well and it provides the possibility of building dashboards if I want to compare more than one graph.
 
The development of the project will start by contrasting in a map the countries that are developed and developing. Once we have an idea about geographical regions we will start summarizing the data by continents to go from general to more specific information. The idea will be to compare variables like life expectancy, GDP, public spenditure, diseases. Then, we can focus the attention on the countries with highest life expectancy and lowest life expectancy to compare them and try to identify the reasons behind the values. Finally, the idea will be to show that living longer depends on the factors analyzed but something important that nobody considered is that social factors like generosity are higher in the countries which are less developed. And the poweful thing here is that we have control about that, so living longer could start with us.
