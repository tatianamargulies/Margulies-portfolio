# Outline

The idea of the project is to give hope to people that life expectancy in poor countries like some in Africa can substantially increase. I will start showing that there is a correlation with factors like GDP,diseases, deaths and therefore, high/low life expectancy. However, one of my findings is that generosity has not usually been considered but has the power to help these countries to improve their life expectancy. The audience is the population and the message is motivational. It is to convince them that even if there are things that as individuals we cannot control because they are external and related more to government strategies, policies, development of country, everyone can have a little contribution to solve this problem by adopting generous practices in our daily lives.

A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a sentence or two that describes what you're interested in showing with your final project.
A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve

# Data
The data to be used in the project consist of three different datasets,

1) Life expectancy: This dataset includes information about all the countries with different time periods from 2000 to 2015. It shows the life expectancy values for each country, some diseases such as HIV/Hepathitis/ Measles, infant deaths, public expenditure on health, schooling, etc.

2) Mapping of continents: This dataset has the mapping of countries and continents to provide some information at a higher level. It will be used at the beginning to show a summary of the situation by continent instead of showing all the countries in the previous dataset.

3) Happiness world index: This dataset has a list of countries with the happiness score for each country as well as the rank. It also shows how factors such as family, trust in government, generosity, contribute to the happiness score. It is going to be merged with the life expectancy dataset

# Method and Medium
 The project is going to be developed using shorthand as a tool to create the presentation and the tool to generate the visualizations will be mainly Tableau.
