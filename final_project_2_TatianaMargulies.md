# User Research Protocol

*Target Audience:*
Population of undeveloped countries like Sierra Leone in Africa with poor distribution of resources, little education, and low access to health services. Particularly citizens between 15-40 years old because life expectancy in these countries is too low (average of around 40 years old). Therefore, to generate an impact we will need to action before that age.

*Motivation:* 
Coming from an actuarial background, I was interested in the longevity topic and I have a passion to help people and try to create a better future for the next generation. When I found this topic, I thought it was going to be a great opportunity to combine both aspects. Sometimes we tend to believe that the drivers behind the current problems are external and we do not realize that we can contribute to an extend to make the change possible. I want to raise awareness and give hope with my findings.
