# Changes from Part 1

After submitting part 1 and reviewing the data in detail, I decided to make a small change in the message to convey. I am going to base my analysis in the comparison of Finland (high life expectancy) and Sierra Leone (low life expectancy) and the idea is to show factors that made Finland a country with people living longer. Some of them are external and related to governement strategies and policies but some factors are internal and are social. All of them are high in Finland and low in Sierra Leone. My message will be to try to focus on the internal factors that are the ones we have control over such as Family time, Generosity, Freedom. These factors are related to happiness and studies show that happiness contributes to living longer. Thus, in other words, we can contribute to living longer.

# Moodboard

I created this moodboard using Canva which shows a sense of hope and happiness given that life expectancy could improve by focusing on the social factors. I thought it was a good idea to give a more visual focus on my message. I incorporated some of these ideas in the wireframes and storyboard.

# Wireframes in Shorthand

In the first part of the final project, I created some sketches to start building my story. In this part, I went far and I tried to build my story using Shorthand to get familiar with the tool. However, the main reason why I decided to use Shorthand was that I wanted to create an advance draft of what the final project was going to look like. By doing that, I was able to ask for feedback to some people and get a more accurate idea of improvements when I documented the findings. 

Below is the link to the wireframes and storyboard in Shorthand

# User Research Protocol

**Target Audience**

Population of developing countries like Sierra Leone in Africa with poor distribution of resources, little education, and low access to health services. Particularly citizens between 15-40 years old because life expectancy in these countries is too low (average of around 40 years old). Therefore, to generate an impact we will need to action before that age.

**Motivation**

Coming from an actuarial background, I was interested in the longevity topic and I have a passion to help people and try to create a better future for the next generation. When I found this topic, I thought it was going to be a great opportunity to combine both aspects. Sometimes we tend to believe that the drivers behind the current problems are external and we do not realize that we can contribute to an extend to make the change possible. I want to raise awareness and give hope with my findings.

**Approach to identifying individuals**

The objective in my approach will be to gather people from different backgrounds so that we do not bias the results. For example, one participant is a psychology student. Why? Because my topic is related to a change in behaviour and the relationship between social factors and longevity. She will be interested in the topic and she could give me constructive feedback about ideas to implement and show the findings. Also, I asked the questions to a refugee that came to Australia so that he can give more feedback about how to approach my audience in conveying the general message. My audience is people with low resources so he may be more touched about the story and help me with the emotional and motivational goal. I will focus more in people with social sciences background. I prepared a script with questions and the approach will be to show them the presentation and then think of answers to my questions. The questions asked are related to understanding of the story, previous knowledge, consistency, visualization critique, emotional aspects, motivation to contribute to a change and finally, feedback for improvement.


# Research Goals

The main goals that I had before starting the interviews were,

- Understanding: I wanted to know if the participants got the key message of the story and understood who was the target audience I was planning to get attention from. This is esential and if it is not clear, it means I need to adjust the story.

- Previous Knowledge: As this topic is not so well-known, I wanted to see if people had an idea about my findings before reading the story I showed them. This also helps to see if people who are not familiar with the topic can follow the flow of the story

- Consistency: A good story is easy to follow, the visualizations supports the story instead of creating more confusion. If somethhing is misleading, it is better to identify it now so that I can improve it for the final project.

- Design: The aim here is to apply concepts learned in the course so far to make it simple but meaningful. Because of that, I want to ask for feedback in elements like colors, size, layout, titles, etc.

- Emotions: I want to reach my audience not only with the technical details and numbers but also with feelings. My topic is sad for poor countries but I am trying to give hope. I would like to know the feeling process while the read the story.

- Motivation: As I want to give a motivational message, I want to understand how well is the message transmitted, whether people feel like inspired to focus more on improving social factors or not. 

- Area of Improvements: After all the previous analysis, the idea is too see general comments that people think can enhance the story. Opinions and changes to implement into the presentation to be more persuasive.

# Interview Script 

With the goals in mind, I focused on preparing the interview script that we can find below,

Thank you for your time in helping me with your feedback.

I am doing a project for a course at university called "Telling Stories With Data". I am doing a final project and I chose to talk about Life expectancy in poor countries. This is a draft of what the final project is going to look like. I appreciate if you can help me reading the presentation and answering the following questions to improve the final version. I would like to evaluate these aspects in order to prepare a more persuasive presentation and reach my target audience.

- Do you understand the message of the story? What is it? Do you know who the target audience is?
- Did you know about the relationship between social factors and life expectancy?
- Do the visualizations support the idea? Did you find anything confusing? 
- Are the colors/design/layout/size/labels/etc appropriate? Are the visualization eye-catching? 
- How did you feel after reading? 
- Were you inspired to think that you can make a change possible?
- What worked well and bad? Is there anything that you would change? 

Thank you so much for your time and answers.

# Findings

The first participant came as a refugee to Australia when he was young to look for better opportunities. He answered the following,

| Objective     |  Male - 33 years old - Social Sciences (Coaching & Leadership)   |
| ------------- | -------------  |
| Understanding  | There is a multi-factor correlation between life expectancy and the development of a country.  External factors such as public policies and governance are not easily altered but individuals can improve their chances of living longer by implementing internal factors such as living happily and generously.  The target audience is the general populace - people simply trying to make a better life for themselves and others around the world as well but mainly people from underdeveloped countries. |
| Previous knowledge  | Before this presentation, only a little. |
| Consistency  | Yes, the visualizations support the idea.  The graphics and text are on point, easily understandable, and well-supported. |
| Design  | Yes, the visualizations and formatting are appropriate and eye-catching.  |
| Emotions  | It touched me and reminded me of my time with my family. I feel like I want to hug them now. I also feel inspired to support people and emotional.  |
| Motivation  | Yes, the presentation inspires me to support various causes that uplift people around the world. Not only in my country. Sometimes it is hard to think that we can make a change but this presentation left me with willingness to help. We need to coach people with a new way of thinking |
| Improvement | The data and graphics are clear and the tone is inspiring; the presentation overall works very well. Recommendations: It might be good to change the title, it could be "life expectancy analysis of Developing and Developed Nations" because you analyse developed countries too. Also, just make sure to show the labels for the negative factors. |

The second participant answered the following,

| Objective     | Male - 26 years old - Social Sciences (Economist)    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Understanding  | Yes, the message that we can make a difference to change for better is clear. I believe the target audience is people from poor countries, people interested in economics and the general public as well.  |
| Previous knowledge  | Yes, but I had not thought about it with the level of detail on this article. I've just heard about a possible relationship on some talks or articles  |
| Consistency  | Yes absolutely, the visualizations are very clear and do support the idea. Nothing confusing from my end |
| Design  | Yes, the design is adequate, the visualizations are eye-catching. The colors are appropiate, the layout and the labels are correct  |
| Emotions  | This article made me think about how sometimes in life we prioritize some things that we think might makes us happier but then actually don't as much as we thought. And I realised that other things as these social factors are more important than what we think. |
| Motivation  | Yes indeed, as the article says even though sometimes we might feel small in this huge world, I believe that each person can make a difference and change the world for the better. I felt inspired after reading Ghandi's quote. Good ending.  |
| Improvement | I really liked the inspiring message of the article and the perspective of the internal factors. The transition of maps is also nice. As a recommendation, I would try to use images in higher resolution in order to have a more professional look as a whole. And maybe rephrase some paragraphs, I know it is a draft.  But overall, the presentation and the links to the studies look good. It shows that you hvae done research about the topic.  |

The third participant answered the following,

| Objective     | Female - 23 years old - Social Sciences (Psychologist)    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Understanding  | From my understanding, the story compares the factors affecting life expectancy in developed and developing countries. It also talks about a few ways to improve longevity in poor countries. It sounds like the target audience is the residents of developing countries.  |
| Previous knowledge  | Social factors are positively related to life expectancy.  |
| Consistency  | Yes, the visualisations support the idea. I found the transitions very interesting. |
| Design  | Yes, the graphs are eye-catching. I like the design and the flow of the presentation |
| Emotions  | It made me feel like it is possible to start making a change from just one person.  |
| Motivation  | Yes. Change starts from within!  |
| Improvement | “Change starts with you” was very empowering and motivational. However, it could be elaborated with ways to do so. This section of the presentation felt a bit short in comparison. You can add more things into that part. it looks like the project is more to educate about the difference between the two countries and not about how to contribute to the change as much. Also, some of the terminologies were not explained. So it left me confused.  |

After the critique exercise in class, I also got some feedback:

- Change color in negative external factor for Finland (I forget to put blue as the graph above)
- The second map color has orange and it can be confused with the orange in the previous map
- Use of infographics could be useful for the factors 

# Plan to implement new insights

After talking to some people and getting their feedback, I analyzed their answers and my research goals to see how well each goal was achieved.

- Understanding: It seems like everyone understood who was my target audience and the message to convey. Some people gave a wider answer for the audience but overall all of them were going in the same direction. It was not confusing.

- Previous Knowledge: Only a person in the psychology field knew about the relationship between social factors and life expectancy. It was a new finding for everyone.

- Consistency: In the negative external factors part, the labels were not included. This was a mistake when I copied the image and croped it. The title of the presentation should be analysis of developing but also developed countries to be more consistent with the story. Also, some terminologies were not explained.

- Design: Overall good. Some images were not in high resolution

- Emotions: A bit more emphasis in the internal factors will help to achieve more emotions. It is short compared to the rest of the presentation.

- Motivation: It worked well for everyone but I can include some ways to contribute as well.

- Area of Improvements: Summarizing all the comments that I received, this is the conclusion:

**Worked well**:

- Understanding of audience and key message
- Design and transitions
- Research about the topic
- Supporting visualizations
- Inspiration feeling

**Worked bad**:

- Internal factors part too short
- Terminologies not explained
- Low resolution in some images
- Some labels missing for diseases in negative external factors
- Title add developed countries too

**What I would change**:

- Mention ways to contribute implementing social factors
- Extending internal factors part
- Rephrase some paragraphs

I will consider what worked well, bad, what I would change and the feedback from my classmates to implement these changes in the final version of the project so that my story results more effective.
