# Highest Debt to GDP ratio country

This is a pie chart which shows the comparison of only some countries to quickly identify which is the country with highest and lowest debt to GDP ratio each year. It is ordered by values to follow the order of the pie. The interactive filter allows us to select the year of comparison instead of showing all the information, which makes the graph visually easy to understand. The color scale used is good for colorblind people.

The three methods used to analyze the dataset were: bar graph, grid of lines and pie chart. 

The bar graph has all the information that is necessary to understand the story that the data is telling, the countries and the values of the ratio. However, it only shows 2018 year which is good because it is the latest available year but at the same time, the user could be interested in looking at comparison among other years. As the graph is showing all the countries, I only highlighted the top debt-to GDP ratio countries so that the user can quickly identify them. It shows that in 2018, Italy, Greece and Japan were the countries with the highest ratio.

The grid of lines shows the trend for all the years, providing the trend for each country in terms of the debt-to-GDP ratio. For example, it is easy to identify that Japan has an increasing trend over the years. It is a good graph to compare and try to estimate future development of debt but it is hard to identify the values with accuracy as it shows more trends instead of values. For that reason, I created the third visualization.

The pie chart shows the exact values of the ratio for the countries, so we can quickly identify the highest values. I compared only some countries as it is less busy and communicates the idea clearer. The filter functionality solves the problem of the years as we can select the year that we want to see. For example, in 1996, Belgium has the highest ratio.
