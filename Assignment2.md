# Visualization 2 (using Flourish)

This is a pie chart which shows the comparison of only some countries to quickly identify which is the country with highest and lowest debt to GDP ratio each year. It is ordered by values to follow the order of the pie. The interactive filter allows us to select the year of comparison instead of showing all the information, which makes the graph visually easy to understand. The color scale used is good for colorblind people.
