# Changes in the Story

Part 1 of the project was useful in the way that it helped to sketch the idea of the project. I started thinking about the message, how to present the data, which graphs were more effective and to have an idea of the audience.
In part 2, I could narrow down the analysis and focus on a more specific audience. I improved the visualizations using tools and created a draft of the presentation to show to people.
With that in mind, I received comments and feedback that made me realised that still there was a lot to improve and I got ideas to implement in the final story. It also helped me to notice that I needed to extend the last part of the story to reach my audience. I was not giving so much attention to that and it was a key issue in the story.
Because of the previous two parts, I arrived to the third part of the project with a clearer picture of what changes I needed to implement. 

I decided to make the following modifications in my story,


1) I extended the internal factors part because it represents my main message and it was short in comparison to the introduction 
2) I explained terminologies that I assumed people already knew like GDP (Gross Domestic Product)
3) I changed some images to improve the resolution
4) I added the labels which say the name of the disease in the negative internal factor comparison. It was missing because of the size of the image.
5) I changed the title and added developed countries too because my comparison is between developing and developed countries
6) I rephrased some paragraphs of the story to use a more effective language for the purpose of the presentation
7) I mentioned some ways to contribute to living longer. The call to action was there but now I also gave some ways to make it possible apart from the fact of conveying the message.
